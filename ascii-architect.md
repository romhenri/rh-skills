# ASCII Diagram Architect

A specialized skill for generating high-utility, tool-agnostic ASCII diagrams and flowcharts within code comments or documentation, following the formal *"Design Space of ASCII Drawings"* (Hayatpur et al., 2024).

---

## Trigger Instructions
Use this skill when the user asks to:
- "visualize,"
- "diagram,"
- "flowchart," or
- "map out"

a process, data structure, or system architecture using plain text.

Activate when providing code explanations where a visual representation of logic or memory layout would improve clarity.

---

## Core Principles

### Tool-Agnosticism
Ensure the diagram is strictly monospaced and readable in any basic text editor (IDE, Terminal, Git).

### Proximity of Information
The diagram should act as a *"visual map"* that sits directly above or beside the logic it describes.

### Structured Notation
Use consistent character sets (`+`, `-`, `|`, `v`, `>`) to define boundaries and flow.

---

## The Design Space Workflow
Based on the Hayatpur et al. research, define the following dimensions internally before rendering:

### 1. Content Identification
Determine what is being represented:
- **System Architecture**: High-level components and networking.
- **Data Structures**: Memory layouts, linked lists, or tree nodes.
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Step-by-step logic or state transitions.

### 2. Layout & Connectivity
- **Box-and-Line**: Use `+---+` for entities and `|` or `-` for connections.
- **Flow Direction**: Standardize on top-to-bottom or left-to-right.
- **Alignment**: Ensure all vertical pipes (`|`) align perfectly to maintain the *"box"* shape.

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### The "Box" Standard
Always use a 3-tier boundary for entities to ensure they are visually distinct:

```
+-----------------------+
|      ENTITY NAME      |
+-----------------------+
```

### The "Connector" Standard
Use explicit arrowheads to show directionality. Do not use ambiguous lines.
- **Vertical**: `|` followed by `v`
- **Horizontal**: `---` followed by `>`

### Annotations
Place short, descriptive text next to connectors to explain the transition or logic (e.g., `"if x > 0"` or `"API Call"`).

## Example Workflow: System Request

**Input:** *"Show me how a Load Balancer distributes traffic to three servers."*

**Output:**

```
          [ CLIENT REQUEST ]
                  |
                  v
       +-----------------------+
       |     LOAD BALANCER     |
       +----------+------------+
                  |
        +---------+---------+
        |         |         |
        v         v         v
    +-------+ +-------+ +-------+
    | SRV 1 | | SRV 2 | | SRV 3 |
    +-------+ +-------+ +-------+
```

## Constraints

1. **Do Not** use non-standard Unicode characters (like `┌` or `┐`) unless explicitly requested, as they may break in certain terminal environments or legacy editors.
2. **Maintain Monospace**: Every line must be checked for character-width consistency.
3. **Avoid Complexity**: If a diagram requires more than **80 characters** of width, break it into *"Sub-Modules"* to ensure it fits standard IDE windows.
